    "### Zerui\n",
    "In this second entry of our Illustratum project journal, we will discuss how the idea of exploring the three-body problem came about and the challenges encountered along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "After extensive discussions, the subject of orbital mechanics, which involves the movement of celestial bodies influenced by gravity, was chosen. The decision to focus specifically on the three-body problem stemmed from its intriguing complexity and beauty. The aim was to deepen our understanding of this topic and share the knowledge with others, showcasing the awe-inspiring wonder and enigmatic nature of physics to ignite curiosity in the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, selecting the three-body problem as the project's topic presented challenges. Factors such as difficulty level, relevance, feasibility, and originality had to be carefully considered. Extensive research and tests were conducted to comprehend the intricacies of the three-body problem and its practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, fluid dynamics was considered as the project's focus, enticed by the captivating behavior of fluids under various conditions. The idea was to demonstrate fluid dynamics through interactive simulations and animations on a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, it soon became apparent that fluid dynamics was too intricate and impractical for the project's scope. The field involved complex mathematical concepts and physics, such as partial differential equations, Navier-Stokes equations, Reynolds numbers, and turbulence. Moreover, accurately simulating and realistically representing fluid dynamics demanded substantial computational power and time, rendering a website inadequate for its demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the focus shifted to orbital mechanics, which offered greater feasibility while remaining challenging and captivating. The belief was that interactive simulations and animations on a website could effectively convey the concepts of orbital mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring orbital mechanics led to the realization of its close connection to the three-body problem. It was discovered that orbital mechanics investigates the movement of celestial bodies in response to gravitational forces. Techniques for modeling and predicting the orbits of planets, moons, stars, and other celestial entities using orbital mechanics were explored. The research unveiled the utilization of Newton's laws of motion, universal gravitation, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, conic sections, and numerical integration for solving orbital mechanics problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The allure and practical applications of the three-body problem within the realm of orbital mechanics further captivated attention. Thus, the decision was made to center the project around the three-body problem, showcasing examples and simulations using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the team is diligently working on website development, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various other web technologies. Additionally, efforts are devoted to crafting engaging content for each section, encompassing informative text, captivating images, illustrative diagrams, dynamic animations, and immersive simulations. The completion of the project is eagerly anticipated, awaiting the opportunity to share it with the audience."

    "## Entry 3, 3 March 2023\n",
    "### Zerui\n",
    "This is the third entry in my Illustratum project journal, where I will discuss the three-body problem in more detail and outline my plans for presenting it on our website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three-body problem is a well-known physics problem that explores how three objects move when influenced by gravity. It's a challenging problem because there isn't a single formula that works for all cases, and the motion of the objects can be unpredictable and chaotic. Studying the three-body problem is important in astronomy because it helps us understand how planets, moons, stars, and other celestial bodies orbit each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was fascinated by the three-body problem and its applications in orbital mechanics. Orbital mechanics is the study of how celestial bodies move due to gravity. It helps us model and predict the paths of planets, moons, stars, and other celestial bodies. We can use Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, shapes called conic sections, and numerical methods to solve problems in orbital mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I decided to focus on the three-body problem as the main topic. On our website, I want to show examples and simulations of the three-body problem using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Here are some examples I plan to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The figure-eight orbit: This is a special solution of the three-body problem discovered in 1993. It shows that three objects with the same mass can orbit each other in a figure-eight shape without crashing or flying away. Although this solution is unstable and easily disturbed by small changes, I will demonstrate it through animations and explain how numerical methods were used to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Pythagorean problem: Another special solution discovered in 1767 by Euler. It shows that three objects with mass ratios of 3:4:5 can orbit each other in a right triangle shape without colliding or escaping. Like the figure-eight orbit, this solution is also unstable and sensitive to perturbations. I will create animations and describe how analytical methods were employed to uncover this solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The restricted three-body problem: This is a simplified version of the three-body problem where one object is much smaller than the others. By neglecting the gravitational influence of the small object, we can treat the problem as a two-body scenario with an external force. This approach is useful for modeling spacecraft or satellite motion around large bodies like Earth and Moon. Users will be able to adjust parameters and observe how they affect the orbit of the smaller object through a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The n-body problem: This is a more general version of the three-body problem where gravity influences interactions among multiple objects. For cases with more than two objects, there isn't a general analytical solution, so we rely on numerical methods to approximate their behavior. The n-body problem is applicable to modeling the motion of many celestial bodies, such as star clusters, galaxies, and solar systems. I will provide a simulation where users can create their own n-body systems and observe their evolution over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, I am developing the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies. I am also working on creating content for each section, including text, images, diagrams, animations, and simulations. I am excited to complete the project and share it with our audience."
