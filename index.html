        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is the Three Body Problem?</h2>
        Consider the Earth, Moon and Sun orbiting around each other in space. Now, further consider the Earth, Jupiter and Sun orbiting around each other. In these two cases, the Moon and Jupiter exhibit differing motions around the Earth and the Sun. In fact, both of these are special cases of the Three Body Problem.
        <br><br> In essence, the Three Body Problem aims to describe the motions of three point masses, also called bodies (in most contexts, these are planets), whose motion depend only on the gravitational attraction between them.
        <br><br> This may be fairly simple to understand, but it is in fact a complicated problem that has eluded mathematicians since Newton's time.
        <h2>A Brief History of the Three Body Problem</h2>
        The Three Body Problem was first posed by Isaac Newton in 1687, when he published his Principia.
        <br><br> It become of technical importance in the 1720s, where an accurate solution would be applicable to marine navigation, as it would allow for the development of accurate lunar tables to determine longitude at sea. In fact, the Longitude Act 1714 offered up to $20,000 for a method to determine longitude at sea to an accuracy of half a degree. (However, the most accurate solution was developed by John Harrison with the invention of the marine chronometer.)
        <br><br> Throughout the years, many special case solutions have also been found, some of which will be explained in Section 4.

        <h1>A Look at the Two Body Problem</h1>
        The Two Body Problem is a simplified version of the Three Body Problem, where, as its name suggests, there are two point masses instead of three.
        <br><br> This problem was first posed, and solved, by Newton in the same book Principia.
        <h2>Newton's Laws of Motion</h2>
        Before we get into the problem, let us first understand the basics of motion.
        <br><br> Newton's First Law: A body remains at rest, or in motion along a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. This should make a lot of sense.
        <br><br> Newton's Second Law: The force acting on a body can be described by $$F=ma,$$ where $m$ is the mass of the body and $a$ is its acceleration.
        <br><br> Newton's Third Law: When two bodies exert a force on each other, the forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions. For example, if you are pushing someone, both of you experience the same force, but in opposite directions.
        <h2>Gravitational Force</h2>
        Next, we should also understand what the force between the planets is. This is known as gravitational force, which is essentially how strongly one planet attracts another planet.
        <br><br> Gravitational force can be described using the following relationship: $$F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2},$$ where $G=6.67\times10^{-11}$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two planets and $r$ is the distance between the two planets (measured from each of their centres).
        <br><br> In other words, the gravitational force increases linearly with the mass of the planets and decreases quadratically (much faster) with the distance between them.
        <br><br> Sometimes, the gravitational force would also be written with a negative sign to signify that it is an attractive force.
        <h2>The Equations of the Two Body Problem</h2>
        In the Two Body Problem, the two bodies exert a gravitational force on each other. To express this mathematically, we let the two bodies have masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and let the distance between them be $r$. Then at any point in time, we always have $$m_1a_1=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad m_2a_2=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}.$$ The minus sign in the second equation is due to Newton's Third Law, since the forces act in opposite directions. These two equations can be solved to yield a general solution to the Two Body Problem. <a href="#urmother" onclick="setTimeout(function() {MathJax.typeset()}, 500)" class="no-justify">:A nice solution to this problem</a>
        <br><br> In the general solution, the two bodies will orbit around their centre of mass in an elliptical orbit, as shown below.

        <h1>The Chaos of the Three Body Problem</h1>
        Finally, we will investigate what happens in the Three Body Problem.
        <br><br> Similar equations can be written as in the Two Body Problem, but now, the equations become unsolvable.
        <br><br> The main reason for this is the lack of symmetry in the Three Body Problem as compared to the Two Body Problem, where the force on each body was equal in magnitude due to Newton's Third Law. In the Three Body Problem, each body experiences a force from the two other bodies, disrupting the symmetry.
        <br><br> In fact, under most initial conditions, the Three Body Problem exhibits chaotic motion, meaning it is impossible to determine the future movement of the three bodies.
    </div>
    <div class="sect">
        <h1>Special Case Solutions to the Three Body Problem</h1>
        There are a few special case systems which yield stable solutions.

        <h2>Figure Eight</h2>
        This solution consists of 3 equal masses moving around a figure-eight shape. In this simulation, the system will still remain stable if we change the mass of all three bodies a little bit, to 0.99 for example. However, it will become unstable if we change the mass too much. <br><a href="#urmother2">:Why?</a>
        <br><br>Just for fun, try increasing the speed of the simulation - at certain speeds, you will see weird stroboscopic effects. (Warning: this can make you dizzy.)

        <h2>Lagrange Point L5</h2>
        Here, Body B is located at the L5 Lagrange point of the Bodies A and C. This is one of the 5 Lagrange points, which are points of equilibrium under the two bodies. The L5 point lies $60^{\circ}$ behind Body C, and Body B located there will forever remain in that position as Body A orbits around Body C.
        <br><br>Note that the L5 Lagrange point only exists if one of the bodies is significantly larger than the rest. Try adjusting the bodies to have similar masses, and you should see the system turning chaotic instead.
        <br><br>In addition, certain orbits (halo orbits, and to some degree, Lissajous orbits) around Lagrange points L1, L2 and L3 are also stable.

        <h2>Earth and Jupiter</h2>
        Here, 2 of the 3 masses are small, and we can make the assumption that the gravitational force between the two minor masses is negligible, and this reduces to two separate 2 body cases.

    <h1>:x Urmother</h1>
    Consider a similar system with mass \(m_1\) under its original conditions, but replacing mass $m_2$ with a phantom mass $M$ with infinite inertial mass and gravitational mass $m_2\left(\dfrac{r_1}{r_1+r_2}\right)^2$. Note that this replacement does not affect the motion of $m_1$ as it exerts the same force on $m_1$ as $m_2$. Thus, this reduces to a one body case, which has well-known solutions of conic sections.
    <h1>:x urmother2</h1>
    The initial velocity and positions of the bodies are fixed, but as you can imagine, the figure eight shape should be larger if the masses are larger, and vice versa.
